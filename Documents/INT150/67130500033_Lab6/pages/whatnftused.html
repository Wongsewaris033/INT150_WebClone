    <h3>What is NFT Used For?</h3>
<body>
    <p>People interested in Crypto-trading and people who like to collect artwork often use NFTs. Other than that, it has 
        some other uses too like:</p>
    <p><span class="usage">Digital Content</span> - The most significant use of NFTs today is in digital content. Content creators see their profits 
        enhanced by NFTs, as they power a creator economy where creators have the ownership of their content over to the 
        platforms they use to publicize it.</p>

    <p><span class="usage">Gaming Items</span> - NFTs have garnered considerable interest from game developers. NFTs can provide a lot of benefits 
        to the players. Normally, in an online game, you can buy items for your character, but that’s as far as it goes. 
        With NFTs, you can recoup your money by selling the items once you’re finished with them.</p>

    <p><span class="usage">Investment and Collaterals</span> - Both NFT and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) share the same infrastructure. DeFi applications 
        let you borrow money by using collateral. NFT and DeFi both work together to explore using NFTs as collateral instead.</p>

    <p><span class="usage">Domain Names</span> - NFTs provide your domain with an easier-to-remember name. This works like a website domain name, making 
        its IP address more memorable and valuable, usually based on length and relevance.</p>
